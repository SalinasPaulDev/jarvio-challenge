// src/components/blocks/index.ts
// Export all block components from a single file for easy importing

export { default as CustomBlock } from "./CustomBlock";

// We could create specific components for each block type if needed:
// export { default as AmazonSalesBlock } from './AmazonSalesBlock';
// export { default as AIAgentBlock } from './AIAgentBlock';
// export { default as GmailBlock } from './GmailBlock';
// export { default as SlackBlock } from './SlackBlock';

// For now, we'll use the generic CustomBlock for all types
// This keeps the code clean and manageable
